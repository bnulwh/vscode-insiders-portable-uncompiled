Visual Studio Code Insiders is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and
debugging modern web and cloud applications.  
You can find the website for it [here](https://audition-csblock.github.io/vscode-insiders-portable-uncompiled/).  

It has all the same features as Visual Studio Code, plus, 
it leaves no personal information behind on the machine you run it on,
so you can take it with you wherever you go.

This is the "Insiders" edition, which means it is the latest update of VSCode.
This also means it can have bugs, you can submit bugs [here][C5].
